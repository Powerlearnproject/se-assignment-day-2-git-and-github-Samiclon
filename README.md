## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
**ANSWER**

1. Version control is a system that helps manage changes to software code over time. e.g tracking changes

2. Ease of use: GitHub provides an intuitive interface that makes it easy for developers to manage their code repositories.

3. Change Tracking is one way version control helps maintain project integrity as every change made to the code is recorded.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
**ANSWER**

**1.** 

i) Sign in to GitHub
   
ii) In the upper-right corner of the page, click the + icon and select New Repository.

ii) Enter the repository detail

iv) Initialize the Repository

v) Click the create repository button

vi) Clone the Repository. i.e click the code button and copy the URL

**2.** The decisions include:

Choose a name for the Repository

Decide whether the repository is 'Public' or 'Private'

Initialize with README




## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
ANSWER

It provides an overview and serves as the first point of contact for anyone interacting with the project.

Instruction.

It reflects the goals and objectives of the project.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

ANSWER
Public repositories are better for broad collaboration, while Private repositories are suited for controlled, smaller team environments.

ADVANTAGES OF PUBLIC REPOSITORIES

Wide collaboration

Visibility

Community feedback

DISADVANTAGES OF PUBLIC REPOSITORIES
 
 Security risks
 Quality control

 ADVANTAGES OF PRIVATE REPOSITORIES

 Controlled access
 
 Security
 
 Focused collaboration

 DISADVANTAGES OF PRIVATE REPOSITORIES

 Limited exposure

 Cost implication

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
ANSWER

Steps

Create a New Repository

Initialize a Git Repository

Add Files to the Repository

Commit the Changes

Add the remote Repository

Push the changes to GitHub.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
ANSWER:  


## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
