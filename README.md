## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
**ANSWER**

1. Version control is a system that helps manage changes to software code over time. e.g tracking changes

2. Ease of use: GitHub provides an intuitive interface that makes it easy for developers to manage their code repositories.

3. Change Tracking is one way version control helps maintain project integrity as every change made to the code is recorded.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
**ANSWER**

**1i.) Sign in to GitHub
   
ii) In the upper-right corner of the page, click the + icon and select New Repository.

ii) Enter the repository detail

iv) Initialize the Repository

v) Click the create repository button

vi) Clone the Repository. i.e click the code button and copy the URL

**2.** The decisions include:

i) Choose a name for the Repository

ii) Decide whether the repository is 'Public' or 'Private'

iii) Initialize with README




## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
ANSWER

**1.** It provides an overview and serves as the first point of contact for anyone interacting with the project.

**2.** The following should be included in a README file namely:

i) Title

ii) Description

iii) Table of Contents

iv) Instruction.

**3.** It reflects the goals and objectives of the project.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

ANSWER
**1.** Public repositories are better for broad collaboration, while Private repositories are suited for controlled, smaller team environments.

**2.** ADVANTAGES OF PUBLIC REPOSITORIES

i) Wide Collaboration

ii) Visibility

iii) Community Feedback

**3.** DISADVANTAGES OF PUBLIC REPOSITORIES
 
 i) Security risks
 
 ii) Quality control

 **4.** ADVANTAGES OF PRIVATE REPOSITORIES

 i) Controlled access
 
 ii) Security
 
 iii) Focused collaboration

 **5.** DISADVANTAGES OF PRIVATE REPOSITORIES

 i) Limited exposure

 ii) Cost implication

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
ANSWER

**1.** Steps

i) Create a New Repository

ii) Initialize a Git Repository

iii) Add Files to the Repository

iv) Commit the Changes

v) Add the remote Repository

v) Push the changes to GitHub.

**2.** Commits are snapshots of projects' current state, capturing all changes made since the last commit.

**3.** Commits are essential for tracking changes and managing the development of projects over time. Every commit includes a message that describes what changes were made and why. 


## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
ANSWER:  

**1.** A branch is created to work on new features, fix bugs, or experiment with ideas. 

**2.** Branching allows multiple people to work on different parts of the project simultaneously, and it keeps the main project stable and clean.

**3.**  The process includes:
i) Navigate to the project directory using the terminal

ii) Use the command, 'git checkout -b new-branch-name'

iii) Make and commit changes

iv) Push the branch to GitHub

v) Create a pull request

vi) Merge the branch after review

vii) Delete the branch


## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
**ANSWER**

**1.** Pull Request is essential for documentation as it serves as a record of what changes were made and why, which is useful for future reference.

**2.** Once a Pull Request is opened, team members can review the changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements before the code is merged.

**3.** Steps Involved in Creating and Merging a Pull Request.

i) Push the branch

ii) Open a Pull Request

iii) Fill out the Pull Request Form 

iv) Submit the Pull Request

To Merge a Pull Request, resolve conflicts then merge into the main branch by clicking the Merge pull request button on GitHub.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

**ANSWER**

**1.** Forking a repository is creating a personal copy of someone else's project to make changes, experiment, or contribute back to the original project.

**2.** 

Forking is to create a copy on GitHub for independent development and contributions.

Cloning is to create a local copy for development on the computer.

**3.** 

i) Collaboration: Forking facilitates collaboration among developers who may not have

ii) Creating Independent Projects: A developer might want to create a new project based on an existing one.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
